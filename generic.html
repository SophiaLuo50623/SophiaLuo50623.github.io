								<h2>2023 NCAE Cybergames Invitationals  in Tampa, Florida </h2>
								<p>In late April of 2023, I was given a valuable opportunity to go to Florida with fellow members of my university's cybersecurity club.</p>
								<p> During the multi hour competition, I endured a grueling process of defending against red team SQL injections. I was tasked with removing/preventing the 
									SQL injection into the MySQL database. I was trying to keep the MySQL Login and SSH from being attacked by the red team, and it was much more 
									difficult than I prepared for. However, I stayed tenacious and helped the rest of my team with their services whenever I felt stuck or needed a break from my own. 
									From this experience, I gained more familiarity with the vim text editor, ssh, shell scripting, and command line tools in macOS/Linux.
								</p>
								<!-- <p>I found the service was down more often than up, and everytime I brought the service online it would be taken down
									by the red team once again. It took me hours, with help from teammates, to try to fix the issue. In a fast-paced and high pressure environment, with 
									side tasks (or distractions) such as trying to track down a red team member and posing with a plastic lizard, my focus and determination were consistently
									challenged.  </p> -->

								<p>Ultimately, our team came in 5th out of 12 universities. Although we may not have won, I was glad that I could experience a full blown red team blue team hackathon for 
									the first time. This opportunity helped me learn critical defence strategies in cybersecurity, such as securing SSH access and MySQL configurations
									and encrypting data using SSH tunneling. 
								</p>
								<h2>2023 University of Connecticut CyberSEEDS Competition </h2>
								<p>For the CyberSEEDS hackathon in Spring 2023, hosted by the University of Connecticut, I was tasked with writing and presenting an incident response briefing on how my team defended against red team attacks. I had to create a slideshow analysis that properly demonstrated what the issue was, what vulnerability in the system was targeted, and how the incident was mitigated. I presented to the judges and 192 other competing teams the technical and non-technical aspects of the incident, while trying to mimic the nature of a professional, industry report. I discussed capital loss, NIST recommendations, CISA compliance and responded to the scrutiny of key stakeholders, while my teammates explained the more technical aspects of solving the issue. Subsequently, my team came in 6th place out of 192 competing universities and were awarded a cheque of $500 dollars!</p>
								<h2>National Cyber League Individual and Team Games, 2022-2024 </h2>
								<p>The NCL competitions were Capture the Flag (CTF) based hackathons, which helped students develop their expertise in various facets of information and cybersecurity. 
									Some skills include open source intelligence, log analysis, forensics, cryptography, and web application security, to name a few. You can learn more about NCL <a href = https://nationalcyberleague.org/competition>here.</a>
									For the NCL 2024 individual competition, I peaked at the 90th percentile early in the competition, and ended at rank 1668 out of 7412 participants. While the competition was challenging and required abstract thinking and 
									online research skills, I was happy that I could develop my knowledge in the many aspects of cybersecurity.

								<h2>Projects</h2>
								<p>Here is a list of some of the projects I've done, both in an academic and independent setting.</p>
								<h3>Academic Projects</h3>
								<li>Used GDB to debug and manipulate assembly code, exploit vulnerabilities in getbuf through code injection techniques, while exploring memory and cache interactions to execute malicious commands at the machine code level in a lab setting.</li>
								<li>
									Programmed a Scheme interpreter, church encoder, and Tic-Tac-Toe game in Racket and Java.</li>
								<li>Implemented functions to create a domain-specific programming language that allows users to specify network topologies and check their connectivity using transitive closure.</li>
								<li>Built a program which used a binary compression table to translate between ASCII text and binary strings in an Excel spreadsheet. Incorporated Python's openpyxl library to interpret the spreadsheet. Led a team in a collaborative and efficient manner during the project.</li>
								<p></p>
								<h3>Personal Projects</h3>
								<li>Currently working on an asynchronous multithreaded texting/chat application in Java with the use of socket programming</li>
								<li>Consulted with a client, prototyped, designed and built a recipe database using Object Oriented Java principles, which had CRUD operations and followed storage application conventions.</li>
								<li>Weather app using vanilla HTML, CSS and Javascript with the OpenWeatherMap API to derive weather data.</li>
								<li>Created an Activist Toolkit website promoting Women in STEM with online Replit IDE, also with HTML+CSS+Javascript</li>
								<li>Built a calculator application in both Java and React.js</li>
